# 🐍 Python Nuggets

Welcome to **Python Nuggets** — a casual and growing collection of Python knowledge, tips, tricks, and insights I come across or want to remember. No strict structure, just useful Python bits dropped in as they come to mind.

## 📌 What to Expect

This repo might include:
- Handy Python one-liners
- Code snippets and patterns
- Lesser-known standard library gems
- Pitfalls and gotchas to avoid
- Performance tips
- Notes on Python internals
- Links to cool resources or tools
- Random rants and revelations

## 📂 Structure

There's no rigid structure here.

The layout will evolve as I add more stuff.

## 🤝 Contributing

Right now, this is mostly a personal dump zone — but if you're passing by and have a cool Python nugget to share, feel free to open a PR or issue. Just keep it simple and useful.

## 💬 Why?

Because Python is vast, and you never know when a random trick can save your day. This repo is my way of not forgetting the good stuff and maybe sharing a few gems along the way.

Happy coding! 🧠🔥
